# LoKaBu
This project realizes a cash book for the ordinary household. The core idea of the project is to be able to set up and transport a cash book without any installation, dependencies and setup.

It is based on a SQLite database, which is read and written through a python container. The interface is built dynamically with HTML and JavaScript interacting with the python container.
